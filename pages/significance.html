                Douglas Engelbart had a huge impact on computer science by inventing the begining of what we call the internet now and how we use computer mouses. when he made the NLS it was the first step forward to the modern computers we have now. The computer mouse had such a huge impact on computers before users would have to use a punch card and put that into the computer every time they wanted to use the computer but with the computer mouse they were able to go back and forth through the text.
